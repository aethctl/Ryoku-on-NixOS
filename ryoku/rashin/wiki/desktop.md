# The Ryoku Desktop

Ryoku is a set of surfaces that share one shell and one design language. You do
not need to know which process draws each one to use the desktop, but the map
helps when you want to change something.

## The parts you see

- **Shell:** Quickshell draws the desktop surfaces on every monitor. Go daemons
  provide state and own validated settings.
- **Bar:** the edge instrument for workspaces, time, media, network, audio,
  power, and installed bar plugins. QS Bar is the default style.
- **Dock:** a separate app surface that works with every bar style. It can pin
  apps, show running windows, magnify on hover, and hide to a peek strip.
- **Launcher:** press Super+Space to search apps, open windows, files, actions,
  calculations, packages, media, and web search from one field.
- **Ryoku Hub:** press Super+comma for the page-wide settings app. It owns system,
  shell, and active window-manager settings, with unsupported controls omitted.
- **Desktop stage:** wallpaper, clock, weather, notes, system stats, music, and
  installed desktop plugins live here. Widgets can be moved and resized in
  place.
- **Controls:** press Super+Escape for activity, connections, levels, extensions,
  and hold-to-activate session actions.
- **Rashin:** press Alt+Space for the machine-aware assistant bar. Its console,
  vault, wiki, skills, and source map are optional and local to this machine.

## Keybinds worth learning

| Keys | Opens or does |
|---|---|
| Super+Space | App launcher and command palette |
| Super+Tab | Workspace overview |
| Super+Escape | Controls |
| Super+comma | Ryoku Hub |
| Super+W | Wallpaper and theme picker |
| Super+V | Clipboard history |
| Super+Shift+S | Screenshot and recording action bar |
| Super+L | Lockscreen |
| Alt+Space | Rashin bar |
| Super+K | Keybind cheatsheet |

The keybind editor in Ryoku Hub is the source to use when a chord should change.
The cheatsheet is the quickest way to discover the rest. Provider-specific
shortcuts get their own section without making the shell depend on that
provider.

## Settings have clear homes

Use Ryoku Hub for compositor, display, input, power, lockscreen, launcher,
recording, and system settings. Use QS Bar Settings for the bar layout, widgets,
and dock. Use the Super+W picker for wallpaper and theme. Those surfaces call the
same owners that command-line tools use, so they do not compete over config.

To learn which compositor backs the desktop and what it can do:

```bash
ryoku wm status
ryoku wm caps
```

Continue with [Hyprland in Lua](hyprland-lua.md) or [niri in
KDL](niri-kdl.md) only when the Hub cannot express a raw config change. See
[Rashin](rashin.md) for the two assistant lanes and approval choices.
