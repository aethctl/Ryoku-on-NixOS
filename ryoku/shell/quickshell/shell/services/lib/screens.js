// EasyEffects initialising its render context on first launch) can leave two live
// ShellScreen objects for the same physical output at once. Every per-monitor
// surface (the bar, notification popups, the OSDs, the per-screen state slices) is
// fanned across this list, so an un-deduped duplicate maps two of each -- the
// visible symptom is two stacked bars, the rest is the desktop "tweaking out".
//
// Keep the first valid occurrence of each output name: one physical output always
// maps to exactly one surface, and holding the first object avoids rebuilding
// every per-monitor surface for a duplicate that the compositor is about to drop.
