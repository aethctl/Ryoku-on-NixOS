// Every entry here must actually be honoured in act or apply. Claiming one this
// provider cannot perform is worse than omitting it: the desktop would offer a
// control that does nothing.
//
// The manifest was set by probing a live 0.17.4 instance (nested, headless),
// not by reading docs; the probe answers are pinned in the local plan.
//
// The absences are mango's design, not gaps to fill later:
//
// CapGlobalShortcuts: mango implements no global-shortcuts portal, so keybinds
// reach shell surfaces by spawning `ryoku-shell <verb>`, the proven niri path.
//
// CapCursorSet: cursor_theme and cursor_size are config keys and a live reload
// picks them up, but there is no imperative call: apply writes them and
// cursor.reassert answers by regenerating and reloading, which is the honest
// shape of the verb on a file-driven compositor.
//
// CapScreenShader, CapPlugins, CapFocusGrab: mango has no plugin system, no
// per-window shader stack, and no focus-grab protocol.
//
// CapPersistentScreenCapture: unproven. reload_config re-notifies watchers and
// grim survives a reload in the nested probe, but whether a long-lived grabbing
// layer surface survives a real mode change on hardware was not established, so
// the launcher frost stays a solid drawer here exactly as on niri. One-shot
// captures (grim, the overview) work — screencopy is served.
//
// CapOutputHdr: mango's HDR lives in the separate wl-only/Vulkan branch; the
// scenefx build Ryoku ships cannot take it, so the claim would be a lie for
// every box Ryoku installs.
//
// CapOverviewState / CapOverviewBackdrop / CapColumnFill: the watch grammar has
// no overview event and no column readback, so the wallpaper pause rules and
// the backdrop surface stand aside as they do on Hyprland.
//
// CapWorkspaceMoveToOutput: tags are monitor-bound in the dwl model; tagmon
// moves a window's tag view, not the tag itself, so the control is gated off
// rather than faked.
