// ---- reconciler: ryoku channel pin -------------------------------------------
//
// reconcileChannelPin heals a packaged box whose [ryoku] pin drifted onto a
// frozen release OLDER than the release actually installed -- the #291 wedge a
// failed boot-guard revert leaves behind: the pin was rewritten to the previous
// release but the downgrade could not complete, so the box runs newer packages
// than the pinned channel serves and can take no further updates.
//
// Deliberate vs accidental is decided by the channel-intent file `ryoku track`
// records (and nothing else writes): a pin that matches the recorded intent is
// the user's own choice and is left alone; a pin that does not is repaired by
// re-tracking the intended channel (stable when none was recorded), which moves
// the pin, the sync db, and the installed set back into agreement through the
// same transactional path `ryoku track` uses.
