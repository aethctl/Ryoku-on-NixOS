# Ryoku on NixOS

**力と美のために** &middot; *For the sake of power and beauty.*

Ryoku is a hand-built Arch Linux distribution. **Ryoku on NixOS** is the official
NixOS port of the Ryoku desktop: one cohesive Hyprland environment, a guided
installer, and a declarative system definition that reproduces it.

The implementation changes. The identity does not. Ryoku remains deliberate in
how it looks, moves, and gets out of your way.

## About

Ryoku means power, and the name is the point. The power is a modular shell built
to be extended: the desktop is composed of small, independent surfaces, and a
plugin system is on the way, so the shell grows with what you actually use
instead of bloating by default. The beauty is the shell itself, one continuous
and deliberate surface where the bar, panels, launcher, lockscreen, and session
controls move as a single thing: paper and ink, warm bone type on pure black,
with the frame retinting live from your wallpaper. 力と美のために: for the sake
of power and beauty.

The desktop, the installer, and the system definition all live in this
repository, and every machine is built from it; the repository is the single
source of truth, and a live machine is only ever a deployment target. The
desktop is a Hyprland Wayland session authored in Lua with the Quickshell-based
Ryoku shell on top. Ryoku's alpha series was a fork of Omarchy. From the beta
series on, the tree was pruned and rebuilt from an empty root, so the installer,
shell, theming, tooling, and system definition are all Ryoku's own, and the
current codebase shares no code with Omarchy. The shell is custom: its frame-blob
rendering and some animation curves are adapted from Caelestia.

## The desktop

One motion language across every surface, retinted live from your wallpaper.

Click a status widget on the bar and its controls grow out of the rail as a
popout card, then melt back when you are done.

On first login a short welcome walks you through the desktop: the handful of
keybinds that open almost everything, and a few choices you can make on the
spot, the interface scale, the bar, and which desktop widgets to show.
Everything else waits in Ryoku Settings (`Super + ,`).

## What ships

- **The desktop** under `ryoku/`: the Hyprland session, Quickshell-based Ryoku
  shell, lockscreen, Hub, app configs, helpers, and brand assets.
- **The NixOS implementation** under `nix/`: Nix packages, the NixOS module,
  system bridge, materializer, updater, and Nix-specific runtime integration.
- **The flake** at `flake.nix`: the public entrypoint exposing Ryoku's module,
  packages, installer, checks, and development environment.
- **The installer** as `#install`: integrates Ryoku into an existing flake-based
  NixOS system and builds a normal NixOS generation.
- **The updater** through `ryoku update`: advances the configured Ryoku flake
  input and switches to the resulting NixOS generation.

## Requirements

Ryoku on NixOS currently targets `x86_64-linux` and requires an existing
flake-based NixOS installation.

| | Minimum | Recommended |
|---|---|---|
| CPU | 64-bit x86_64, dual-core | quad-core or better |
| RAM | 4 GB | 8 GB+ |
| GPU | working Wayland / DRM / KMS acceleration | recent integrated or discrete GPU |
| System | flake-based NixOS | recent NixOS |
| Session | Wayland | Hyprland |

Ryoku does not repartition disks, replace the bootloader, choose the system
kernel, or replace the host graphics-driver configuration. Those remain owned by
the existing NixOS configuration.

### Graphics

Ryoku uses accelerated Qt and Hyprland surfaces, so working hardware acceleration
is strongly recommended.

GPU configuration remains declarative and belongs to the host NixOS system.
Ryoku does not automatically replace AMD, Intel, or NVIDIA drivers. If Hyprland
already works correctly on the machine, Ryoku uses that existing graphics stack.

## Install

Ryoku for NixOS installs on top of an existing **flake-based NixOS system**.
It does not repartition the disk or replace NixOS itself; the installer adds the
Ryoku flake and module to your existing configuration, builds a new NixOS
generation, and switches to it.

### Existing NixOS installation

The recommended installation method is the Ryoku NixOS installer:

```bash
nix run github:aethctl/Ryoku-on-NixOS/main#install
```

Preview everything the installer would change without writing anything:

```bash
nix run github:aethctl/Ryoku-on-NixOS/main#install -- --dry-run
```

The dry run shows the proposed `flake.nix` changes and the generated `ryoku.nix`
module, but does not modify your system.

The installer requires an existing flake-based NixOS configuration before installation.

> [!WARNING]
> The NixOS installer is still relatively new and is being tested across different
> flake layouts, hardware configurations, and existing NixOS setups.
>
> It modifies your existing NixOS flake and creates an installer-managed
> `ryoku.nix`, so **back up your configuration before installing**.
>
> Before making changes, the installer stores copies of the affected configuration
> under `/var/backups/ryoku-nixos/`. It also builds the new NixOS generation before
> switching to it, and restores the previous configuration files if the flake lock,
> build, or switch fails.
>
> Run the installer as your normal user; it will request `sudo` only when system
> changes are required. Using `--dry-run` first is recommended on heavily customized
> NixOS configurations.

## Updating

Ryoku updates through the same command:

```bash
ryoku update
```

On NixOS, this does **not** run Pacman or modify Arch packages like the Arch variant. Ryoku uses its
Nix-specific update backend, updates only the configured Ryoku flake input, then
builds and switches to the resulting NixOS generation.

The NixOS implementation follows its own Ryoku source and version lifecycle.
Arch package releases, the `[ryoku]` Pacman repository, and AUR updates do not
control the NixOS release.

Because updates produce normal NixOS generations, the previous system remains
available through the standard NixOS rollback mechanisms if an update causes a
problem.

Your Ryoku settings are preserved across updates. Packaged desktop files are
reconciled to the version shipped by Ryoku, while user-owned overrides remain
separate and load afterwards so your customizations can continue to take
precedence.

On developer installations using a local `path:` flake input, Ryoku reports the
current source and version but deliberately does not mutate the local checkout.
Update the development checkout manually, then rebuild NixOS as usual.

## Release cadence

Ryoku on NixOS follows upstream Ryoku releases, but NixOS releases may arrive
slightly later when new upstream components require Nix-specific packaging or
integration work. The goal is to bring new upstream Ryoku releases to NixOS
within seven days where practical.

## Repository layout

| Path | One job |
|---|---|
| `ryoku/` | The shared Ryoku desktop: Hyprland configuration, Quickshell shell, lockscreen, app configs, CLI, Hub, services, and brand assets. |
| `nix/` | The NixOS implementation: packages, NixOS module, installer, system bridge, materializer, update integration, and Nix-specific runtime glue. |
| `flake.nix` | The public Nix entrypoint exposing the Ryoku NixOS module, packages, apps, checks, and development environment. |
| `VERSION` | The authoritative version of the NixOS implementation. |
| `docs/` | Documentation and supporting guides shared with or adapted from the wider Ryoku project. |

Ryoku's alpha series began as a fork of Omarchy, created by David Heinemeier
Hansson and contributors. From the beta series on it was pruned and rebuilt as an
independent project that shares no code with Omarchy. The Ryoku shell is custom,

the [Caelestia shell](https://github.com/caelestia-dots/shell), and parts of the
display configuration UI adapted from
